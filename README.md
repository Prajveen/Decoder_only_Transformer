# Decoder-Only Transformer for Text Generation

This repository contains an implementation of a decoder-only transformer for natural language processing tasks. Specifically, it excels at predicting the next token or word in a sequence. Letâ€™s dive into the details:

## What is a Decoder-Only Transformer?
The decoder-only transformer is a variant of the original transformer architecture.
Unlike the full transformer, which has both an encoder and a decoder, the decoder-only model focuses solely on generating output sequences.
It is commonly used in generative tasks such as text generation, machine translation, and text summarization.
Key Components:
### 1. Input Prompt (Context):
The decoder-only transformer receives a prompt (often referred to as context) as input.
There is no recurrence; the entire input is processed at once.
### 2. Blocks:
Each block in the decoder stack contains:
A masked multi-head attention submodule: Allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input.
A feedforward network: Adds non-linearity and complexity.
Several layer normalization operations.
Blocks are stacked to make the model deeper.
### 3. Output Layer:
The output of the last block is passed through an additional linear layer to obtain the final model output.
For tasks like language modeling, the output is a probability distribution over the next token.
## Self-Attention Mechanism:
Self-attention is a critical component of transformers.
It allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input.
Each self-attention mechanism (head) computes attention scores between input tokens, determining their importance for the output prediction.
# Applications:
The decoder-only transformer is used in impressive models like GPT-4, ChatGPT, and LaMDa.
It is ideal for tasks where predicting the next token is crucial.
Usage:
## Training:
Fine-tune the decoder-only transformer on your specific task using labeled data.
Adjust hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, as needed.
## Inference:
Use the trained model to generate text by providing an initial prompt.
The model predicts the next token based on the context.
